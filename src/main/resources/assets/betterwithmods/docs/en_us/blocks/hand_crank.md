# Hand Crank

%[Hand Crank](block:betterwithmods:hand_crank@0)

This block is the earliest form of creating Mechanical Power, it can power any machine that does not need _continuous_ Mechanical Power.
For example, the [Millstone](mill.md) will be the first machine you'll want to use the Hand Crank on to begin creating your windmill.
