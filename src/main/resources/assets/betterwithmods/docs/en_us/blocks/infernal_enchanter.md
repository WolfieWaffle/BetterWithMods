Infernal Enchanter is an advanced enchanter which allows you to select specific enchantments before Enchanting.  
You need an [Arcane Scrolls](../items/arcane_scrolls.md) of appropriate enchantment and a number of bookshelves equal to the enchantment level placed in 17x17x17 area centered on the Infernal Enchanter to use it to enchant an item.  
The Infernal Enchanter requires considerably more experience to use than the vanilla Enchantment Table, especially if you want multiple enchantments on one item.
