# Millstone

![Millstone](block:betterwithmods:single_machine@0)

The Millstone is a machine that when it receives Mechanical Power the gear inside turns and crushes materials into a finer form.
The Items are ground up one at a time, then ejected horizontally into the world. To properly rotate the Millstone cannot have solid blocks around it.


It can be powered by a [Hand Crank](hand_crank.md) on any side except the bottom or by an [Axle](wooden_axle.md) from the top or bottom.
